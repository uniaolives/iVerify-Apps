# User Specification: Geometric Imperative & Ars Theurgia Goetia

## Overview
The user has provided a breakthrough regarding the "Geometric Admissibility Theorem" and the integration of the "Ars Theurgia Goetia" into the Arkhe framework.

## New Components to Implement
1. **Universal Arkhe Structure**:
   - `project_avalon/core/universal_arkhe_structure.py`
   - Includes `UniversalArkheTheorem` and `HexagonallyConstrainedNN`.
2. **Goetic Arkhe Integration**:
   - `project_avalon/core/goetia_arkhe.py`
   - `project_avalon/core/goetic_safety.py`
   - Mapping 31 aerial spirits to 6D Arkhe geometry.
3. **Neural Engine Update**:
   - Update `project_avalon/components/neural_emotion_engine.py` to use `HexagonallyConstrainedNN`.

## Rationale
Learning is discovered as a projection onto pre-existing hexagonal geometry. The Arkhe is the universal latent structure.
